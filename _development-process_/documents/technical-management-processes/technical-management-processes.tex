        		\section{Project phases}
        		
					The development process adopted for this project has in its scope the following phases:
        			
        			\begin{enumerate}
        				
						\item Conception: is the first phase of the process, in which it seeks to raise the key requirements and understand the system comprehensively. The results of this phase are usually a requirement and risk document, a high-level use case listing, and a use case-based development timeline.
						\item Elaboration: this phase involves detailed system analysis, domain modeling and system design using the design patterns.
						\item Construction: includes a part of implementation and testing.
        				\item Transition: Upon ready, the system will be deployed replacing the current system of either manual or computerized.
        				
        			\end{enumerate}
        			
        			Subsections 2.2.1 and 2.2.4 present the details of the activities at each stage of the development process adopted.
	        		
	        		\subsection{Conception}

						The conception phase presents in its scope the following activities:	
							
	        			\begin{enumerate}
	        				
	        				\item $[busmdl]$ Business modeling (System overview)
	        					
								In this activity, all possible information about the system must be obtained. The product of this step will be \emph{system overview document}.        				
	        						
					        \item $[reqgat]$ Requirements Gathering
					        
					        	It corresponds to searching for all the possible information about the functions that the system must execute and the reticulations on which the system must operate. The product of this step will be the \emph{requirements document}, main component of the software design.
					        	
							\item $[reqaly]$ Requirements Analysis
							
								It serves to structure and detail the requirements so that they can be approached in the elaboration phase for the development of other elements such as use cases, classes, and interfaces.

							\item $[hlucse]$ High-level use cases
								
								In this activity it is necessary to identify the main use cases of the system. The use cases devel cover the main business activities linked to the system that will be developed.
								
	        			\end{enumerate}
	        			
    	    		\subsection{Elaboration}
    	    		
    	    			The elaboration phase presents in its scope the following activities:
	        			
	        			\begin{enumerate}
	        				
							\item Expansion of use cases								
							\item Determination of events and system responses
							\item Construction or refinement of the conceptual model
							\item Elaboration of operations contracts and system queries
							
	        			\end{enumerate}
